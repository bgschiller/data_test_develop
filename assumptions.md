Some assumptions I made while writing this:

- When we say the Description must contain the word 'and', I'm assuming that merely containing the word 'contraband' (for example) wouldn't be sufficient. I'm requiring a space on either side to make sure that it's really the word ' and ', and not just those three letters appearing as part of another word.
- I'm assuming the word 'and' may appear later in the description (after the 200-char mark) and we still want to include that word.
- I'm assuming that we do not care about the case (upper or lower) of the word 'and', so 'AND' or 'And' would be acceptable.
- I'm assuming (since there are no listings in 2017) that we want to include properties from 2016. There is a line in the code where that can be easily toggled.
